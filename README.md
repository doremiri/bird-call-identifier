# Bird song classifier using Mel-Spectrograms and different neural network models.
The models used in this project are: 
1. CNN
2. ResNet50
3. VGG16
4. VGG19
5. Wav2Vec 2.0

For our implementation we utilized **audio to mel-spectrogram** to process the audio data, and used that to train the models.
